I am a specialist in Natural Language Processing. I am particularly interested in Natural Language Generation (NLG) and Knowledge Engineering. I like solving real-world problems in a variety of domains using abundant data, open-source resources and cutting edge Deep Learning and NLP techniques. I enjoy keeping up to date with the latest progress and outbreaks in my field and am a regular reviewer at NLP conferences. I also like sharing my enthusiasm for NLP by mentoring university students on a range of interesting projects, from Q/A system, end-to-end NLG to Knowledge Graph building.
