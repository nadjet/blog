My name is Nadjet Bouayad-Agha. I am a specialist in Natural Language Processing. I am particularly interested in <a href="https://nadjet.github.io/blog/posts/seq2seq_nlg/" target="_blank">Natural Language Generation</a> (NLG) and <a href="http://nadjet.github.io/blog/posts/concept_mining_environment/" target="_blank">Knowledge Engineering</a>. 

I like solving real-world problems in a variety of domains using abundant data, open-source resources and cutting edge <a href="https://nadjet.github.io/blog/posts/sentence_similarity/" target="_blank">Deep Learning and NLP techniques</a>. 

I enjoy keeping up to date with the latest progress and outbreaks in my field and am a regular reviewer at NLP conferences. Back in the days when I was working at the university, I used to <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8hDdkMkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao" target="_blank">publish papers</a> too.

I also like sharing my enthusiasm for NLP by mentoring university students on a range of <a href="https://nadjet.github.io/blog/posts/masters_topics_q1_2021/" target="_blank">interesting projects</a>, from Q/A systems, end-to-end NLG to Knowledge Graph building.
