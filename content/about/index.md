title: "About myself"
draft: true

My name is Nadjet Bouayad-Agha. I am a specialist in Natural Language Processing. I am particularly interested in [Natural Language Generation](https://nadjet.github.io/blog/posts/seq2seq_nlg/) (NLG) and [Knowledge Engineering](http://nadjet.github.io/blog/posts/concept_mining_environment/). 

I like solving real-world problems in a variety of domains using abundant data, open-source resources and cutting edge Deep Learning and NLP techniques.

I enjoy keeping up to date with the latest progress and outbreaks in my field and am a regular reviewer at NLP conferences. Back in the days when I was working at the university, I used to [publish papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8hDdkMkAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) too.

I also like sharing my enthusiasm for NLP by mentoring university students on a range of [interesting projects](https://nadjet.github.io/blog/posts/masters_topics_q1_2021/), from Q/A systems, end-to-end NLG to Knowledge Graph building.
